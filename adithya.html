    <div class="text-center">

    <div class="text-center">
      <p>It is CSE. The clock strikes 12:50 pm. Suddenly, a string of students begin to chant. At first, the chanting is indistinct, but as the volume gradually increases, the words can be made out:</p><br>
      <p>A...DI...TH..YA!</p>

      <p>After reading about this incredible man, one would be forgiven for thinking that he is but a myth. But he is not. Adithya P. is a very real man who has done a lot of pretty incredible things. <strong><em>But he needs your help.</em></strong></p><br>
      <p>A man like this deserves his own domain. Unforunately, <a href="http://adithya.io" target="_blank">adithya.io</a> is already registered!</p><br>
      <p>To remedy this, we, the <i>Adithya Paramasivam Foundation for the Advancement of Global Education and Outreach Programs</i>, have created a fund called the <i>Adithya Paramasivam Scholarship for Domain Name Identity Rights</i>. Please consider contributing some of your hard-earned money to our noble cause (but if you do it accidentally, you're not a good person). Any amount is appreciated.</p>
